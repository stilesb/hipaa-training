                <p>Protection and privacy come into play once the individual has been uniquely identified. <a href="http://ndep.nih.gov/diabetes-facts/">There are after all 25.8 million Americans who have diabetes</a>. Which leads to the question of what data can be used to uniquely identify an individual. The generally accepted set of individually unique data elements include the <a href="http://www.oshpd.ca.gov/Boards/CPHS/HIPAAIdentifiers.pdf">following</a>:</p>

<style type="text/css">.tftable {font-size:12px;color:#333333; width:100%;border-width: 1px;border-color: #729ea5;border-collapse: collapse;}

            <td>Well, of course i.e. first name, last name, maiden name combinations. One could argue that just any <strong>one</strong> of the above doesn&rsquo;t uniquely identify an individual after all &ldquo;James&rdquo; is a pretty common name. But it could be possible to identify an individual using a combination of data i.e. first name, zipcode, street address etc.</td>

            <td>Everything (street address, city, precinct, zipcode, lat long coordinates etc.) are considered PII. The first three digits of the zipcode are usually considered ok for use except in the case of certain zipcodes which cover a small population (less than 20,000). There are currently 17 zipcodes that fit that profile - 036, 692, 878, 059, 790, 879, 063, 821, 884, 102, 823, 890, 203, 830, 893, 556, 831.

<p>These 18 elements are the core set of data elements that individually or in combination can be used to uniquely identify an individual. And, considering the fact that the above list of identifiers has <strong>fax numbers</strong> and not Twitter @usernames, Facebook IDs, or a host of other modern, more common identifiers, it&rsquo;s clear that the PII list is not the most up to date and some more thought should go into recognizing and protecting identifiable information. However, since patient data is valuable in clinical trials, medical case studies etc., the above list is used as a guideline to ensure privacy.</p>
